  <b>SightRead's <i>Trail</i> view is what Navigation History set out to be, rebuilt from scratch by the same author:</b><br>
  your jumps to definitions and references become a precise call map — callers as parents, callees as children —<br>
  with no noise entries and no performance drag. And it ships with a whole code-reading toolkit around it:<br>
  spotlight, skeleton fold, highlighter markers, auto segmentation and entry points.

## Purpose 🎯

A Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the experience of reading code by providing **a comprehensive history of code navigation** and **a tree structure of calling hierarchies**.

## Use Case Scenarios 🔍

When **exploring a new codebase**, developers typically need to understand the overall architecture. This process usually involves:

1. Locating feature entry points to begin code exploration
2. Navigating through calling hierarchies to comprehend implementations

Common challenges during this process include:

1. Difficulty tracking previously visited locations, especially with deep calling hierarchies and scattered entry points
2. Challenges in grasping the codebase's big picture during initial exploration
3. Identifying interesting or complex code sections while reading the code

Thus, this extension is designed to help developers to:

1. Record the history of code navigation, and organize the history as a tree reflecting the calling hierarchy of each symbol
2. Focus on most important symbols, which could be chosen by visit count or manually pinned

## Key Features ⭐

1. 📍 Maintains a comprehensive history of code navigation
2. 🌳 Record the calling hierarchy of each symbol in a tree structure
3. 📊 Tracks symbol visit frequency, highlighting frequently accessed ones
4. 📋 Enables sorting by visit count or chronological order
5. 📌 Allows pinning of important symbols for focused attention

## Comparison with Existing Tools 🔄

### VS Code's "Open Editors" View 📂

I've found that while "Open Editors" is great for managing files, it's not really designed for helping us understand code. In my experience, I end up using the file palette more often when I need to navigate between files.

### [Code Navigation Stack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RoeeBarnea.code-navigation-stack) Extension 🔍

I like this extension for following a single call path, but I've noticed it struggles when I switch between different areas of code. It gets particularly tricky when I'm jumping between classes in the same file or methods within a class.

### VS Code's "Outline" View 📑

We all know this one - it shows us the symbols in our current file and updates when we switch files. I find it works best when I already know my way around the codebase.

### [CodeMap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oleg-shilo.codemap) Extension 🗺️

I appreciate how this extension gives us a clean view of classes and functions, and I love that we can customize how it parses symbols. But similar to the Outline view, I've found it's most helpful once I'm familiar with the code I'm working with.

## Bug Reports 🐛

I'm happy to report everything's working great so far! But if you run into any problems, I'd really appreciate it if you could let me know by opening an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Release Notes 📝

For detailed updates and changes, please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**Happy Code Reading!** 🚀✨
