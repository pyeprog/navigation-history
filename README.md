# Navigation History 🧭

Hey there! 👋 Looking for a better way to explore your code? This VS Code extension is here to help! It makes reading and navigating through your codebase a breeze by showing you where you've been and helping you understand your code better.

## ✨ What's Cool About This?

### 🗺️ Your Personal Code Map

- Keep track of everywhere you've been in your code
- See how different parts of your code connect
- Never lose your way in the codebase again
- Easily retrace your steps when you need to

### 🎯 Smart Highlights

- Your most-visited code spots get special highlighting
- Different colors show how often you visit each part
- Instantly spot the important bits of your code

## 🤔 Why Do You Need This?

Ever found yourself thinking:

- "Wait, where was I just looking?"
- "How did I get to this part of the code?"
- "What's the big picture here?"

VS Code's "Recently Opened" is nice, but sometimes you need a friendlier way to keep track of your coding journey. That's where we come in!

1. Grab the extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. Open up your project
3. Start exploring your code
4. Check out your navigation history in the Activity Bar
